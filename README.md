# Bonfim Security Constitution

## Preamble

This repository defines the fundamental governance constitution for information security, security operations, and cyber governance.

It establishes immutable principles, decision-making boundaries, and auditable rules that guide all derivative architectures, policies, procedures, and operational artifacts.

This constitution is:
- Security-first by design (SecOps-oriented)
- GDPR-aligned by principle
- Cybersicherheit-oriented by architecture
- Versioned, traceable, and auditable by default

No operational code, personal data, or environment-specific configuration is defined here.

All changes to this constitution are intentional, reviewable, and historically preserved.
