# Bonfim Security Constitution

## What This Repository Is

This repository defines a **constitutional governance framework for Information Security and Cybersecurity**.

It is not a codebase.  
It is not an implementation.  
It is an **authoritative governance layer** that governs how security decisions are made, validated, documented, and audited across systems, teams, and environments.

The repository is designed to operate **above policies, tools, and platforms**, providing a stable and auditable foundation for SecOps, DevOps, and compliance-driven organizations.

---

## Intended Audience

This repository is explicitly designed for:

- Security Architects
- SecOps and DevSecOps Leaders
- Auditors and Compliance Officers
- GRC and Risk Management Professionals
- Technical Recruiters evaluating senior profiles

---

## What Problem This Solves

Many security programs fail due to:
- Implicit decision-making
- Authority drift
- Untraceable governance
- Overreliance on tools instead of accountability

This repository addresses those failures by:

- Defining **who has authority** and **at which layer**
- Making **human accountability explicit**
- Ensuring all decisions are **traceable, versioned, and auditable**
- Separating **governance** from **implementation**

---

## Governance Structure (High-Level)

The governance chain defined here follows this authoritative order:

Constitution  
→ Amendments  
→ Principles  
→ Articles  
→ Policies / Standards / Procedures  
→ Decision Records (ADRs)  
→ Validation (Tabletop Exercises)  
→ Operational Implementations (out of scope)

This structure ensures that **no operational decision exists without governance backing**.

---

## Key Artifacts in This Repository

- **Constitution**  
  Defines immutable governance intent and authority boundaries.

- **Principles**  
  Interpretive anchors (e.g., human accountability).

- **Articles**  
  Enforceable rules and scope definitions.

- **Amendments**  
  Formal change control for the constitution itself.

- **Tree of Authority**  
  Explicit mapping of decision power and precedence.

- **TTX (Tabletop Exercises)**  
  Simulation-based validation of governance assumptions.

- **ADR (Architecture Decision Records)**  
  Formal decisions derived from validated TTX outcomes.

---

## Compliance and Audit Alignment

This repository is aligned with:

- SecOps governance models
- GDPR (data minimization, accountability, traceability)
- ISO/IEC 27001 governance concepts
- Auditability-by-design principles

No personal data, secrets, credentials, or environment-specific configurations are stored here.

---

## How This Repository Is Used in Practice

In a real organization, this repository would:

- Serve as the **top-level security governance reference**
- Be cited by policies, standards, and architectures
- Provide auditors with **clear evidence of decision discipline**
- Prevent undocumented or automated authority escalation

---

## What This Repository Is Not

- Not a security tool
- Not a policy dump
- Not a checklist
- Not a tutorial

It is a **governance system**, intentionally minimal, explicit, and strict.

---

## Status

- Governance framework: **Complete**
- Audit readiness: **High**
- Operational implementations: **Intentionally excluded**

---

## Maintainer Intent

This repository reflects a security-first, governance-driven approach where **clarity, traceability, and accountability** take precedence over tooling and automation.

It is suitable for organizations and teams that treat security as a **structural responsibility**, not a reactive function.
